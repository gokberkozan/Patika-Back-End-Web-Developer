## Book Sorter
### Explanation
Design a class named Book. 
Inherit this class from the Comparable interface and override the "compareTo" method. 
In this method, write the code that sorts the book by name from A to Z.
Create 5 objects from this class and store the objects in a Set type structure. 
Then, for the second time, use a data structure of type Set and arrange the books according to the number of pages.

The Book class consists of book name, number of pages, author's name, and publication date variables.
