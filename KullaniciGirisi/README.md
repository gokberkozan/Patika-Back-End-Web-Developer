## User Login
### Explanation
If the password is incorrect, ask the user whether to reset his password. 
If the user wants to reset it, check that the new password he entered should not be the same as the forgotten password. 
If the passwords are the same, "The password could not be created, please enter another password." 
If there is no problem, write the program that says "Password created".
